Following up on the [previous post](../2024-07-02-knieval/index.qmd), about B. Dolan's poem "The Skycycle Blues", here I want to post the video for my favorite poem of all time, along with the lyrics since I can't find them anywhere online (and since... the spoken-word version has a lot of screaming/noise, so, reading words at your own pace may be more palatable?). Before I heard this poem I had never heard anything like this, and I haven't heard anything like this since, honestly. *sui generis*.

> I know myself, even better than Jesus does.<br>
> I stole from churches. I owe god money.<br>
> There was a girl with no gag reflex,<br>
> And a summer with no idea.<br>
> 
> Stealing, to buy drugs with Kate.<br>
> Who needed her smokes so much more<br>
> than the pope needed another painting in the vatican.<br>
> 
> Days in the warehouse, waiting.<br>
> Katie, and the baby, and Katie.<br>
> 
> On my lunch break, alone,<br>
> us, just wanting to be alone,<br>
> her nature versus nurture.<br>
> She was wild, she was like a berserker fairy.<br>
> Her breath, sweetened with nicotine tar and tension,<br>
> tension and touching behind backs,<br>
> whispers in the house,<br>
> excuses for the dark,<br>
> hands for flesh...<br>
> And the most realest despair in the whole wide universe.<br>
> 
> Her parents were always home and never around.<br>
> Just like her live-in-addict-accidental-baby-daddy.<br>
> His name was Adrian.<br>
> He used to stab himself in the leg with darts for attention.<br>
> I used to watch it all go down,<br>
> and want her.<br>
> 
> I used to feed the baby,<br>
> and try to come down.<br>
> 
> I was eighteen, she was seventeen.<br>
> I was into drugs, she was in love.<br>
> It was all... all about me, as always.<br>
> 
> She heard my first poem.<br>
> All summer we went to cemeteries to smoke.<br>
> That's where I learned,<br>
> to open the box in my throat and sing the blues,<br>
> all over, but mostly in cemeteries.<br>
> All of life lived in me.<br>
> I brought it to Katie,<br>
> and Katie brought life herself, at seventeen.<br>
> Seventeen.<br>
> She loved iced coffee.<br>
> She loved me.<br>
> She loved her daughter.<br>
> She loved her stories.<br>
> She loved everything,<br>
> and wanted only to love.<br>
> I made her write it in a journal.<br>
> 
> And why is it,<br>
> that when I wanted women to inspire themselves,<br>
> and come alive,<br>
> and write their fire into books,<br>
> and bleed like this for themselves and be,<br>
> here, like I got it see, it's not hard,<br>
> you can do it, you should do it,<br>
> more, more, did you? yes, good,<br>
> why is it, that they never did,<br>
> 
> until I kissed them?<br>
> 
> And then, they would write shit about me.<br>
> 
> Which is not what I wanted.<br>
> But was fun.<br>
> And suddenly fed me.<br>
> 
> So I'd forgotten where I was,<br>
> which was,<br>
> in the pages,<br>
> getting tattoed down,<br>
> waiting to be turned over.<br>
> 
> Making the mistake.<br>
> 
> Feeling her in the dark.<br>
> The shock of her smell,<br>
> the strength of her hold on me,<br>
> like we forget how to do when we get older.<br>
> Seventeen.<br>
> She had a grip like her baby.<br>
> 
> Was she thirteen? Or fourteen?<br>
> When one of the Falco brothers,<br>
> laced a joint with PCP.<br>
> Her and her cousin.<br>
> 
> Katie couldn't move<br>
> while he _____ her.<br>
> Her cousin couldn't move<br>
> while she watched.<br>
> 
> For god's sake.<br>
> 
> Please.<br>
> 
> For the love of all time and space.<br>
> In this life and the next.<br>
> From heaven and hell.<br>
> By any power that possibly exists.<br>
> By every force of compulsion in the universe.<br>
> god...<br>
> 
> FUCK the Falco brothers,<br>
> god HATE THEM,<br>
> god DESTROY THEM BEFORE ANYTHING LIKE JUSTICE CAN EVER EXIST!<br>
> THE MOTHERFUCKERS WHO GAVE ME MY FIRST PUNCH IN THE FACE,<br>
> WHO LAID, LIKE THE JACKALS OF CHAOS, OVER THE BEDS OF ANYTHING GOOD!<br>
> THIS IS A HUMAN CANCER, LIVING IN THE SHADOWS OF A GHOST TOWN!<br>
