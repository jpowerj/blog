In another installation of, Jeff posting things on here in order to avoid ranting at friends over WhatsApp... I'm geeking over how incredible B. Dolan's poems are. In my last post I already shared one of them, about traumatic suburban childhoods, but this one is about the motorcycle stunt jumper [Evel Knieval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evel_Knievel){target='_blank'}. I umm... would love to be able to write things like this someday.

> Somewhere, in between heaven and the landing ramp,<br>
> Lies the sacred mathematics of chance, the calculated risk.
> 
> Gasoline. Throttle. Thumbs up. Let her fly!<br>
> And tear into the fabric of an instant<br>
> Where you can live an entire lifetime<br>
> In the star-dusted, flash-bulb infinity<br>
> Of an impossible launch into space,<br>
> That climbs to the top of its arc<br>
> And beats the sky back another inch.<br>
> 
> Only to crumble, and collapse.<br>
> Only to fall, and return to the earth<br>
> With no illusions of immortality,<br>
> And pay the cost of dreaming.<br>
> 
> Like your skin stretched out in ribbons<br>
> Along 100 yards of hot tar.<br>
> Like those ghostly, ruined bones<br>
> On the X-ray photo.<br>
> Like the steel plates,<br>
> The pins and the screws they jam into you,<br>
> Until you've got more in common with your bike<br>
> Than you do with any human being.<br>
> 
> By 1976, Evel Knievel's body is a monument in ruins.<br>
> The scorched remains of the war<br>
> He waged against his own flesh.<br>
> Kids come home crippled from Vietnam<br>
> Writing him letters saying, "Thank you, sir.<br>
> I figure, if you can get back up and go on,<br>
> Then I can too."<br>

*(And, if you're okay with spoilers... the ending:)*

> But as he flies across the gaps<br>
> Between his public appearances,<br>
> Burning through cocaine like money,<br>
> With women whose faces are made up<br>
> To look like neon motel signs,<br>
> He begins to feel the vacancy<br>
> Of a million lights shining on his skin.<br>
>
> You're Evel Knieval, the twinkle in America's eye.<br>
> 
> But every day you age another year.<br>
> And you watch, as if in a dream,<br>
> As you fail every single person in your life,<br>
> To pay the cost of dreaming.<br>
>
> The botched attempts, the bankruptcies,<br>
> The divorce, the loss of your family.<br>
> All the bad blood in your veins,<br>
> From hepatitis, kidney failure.<br>
> In a wheelchair, in old age,<br>
> Living to discover yourself<br>
> Shrinking to the size of a footnote.<br>
> A novelty, a gag, an oddity.<br>
> All of it part of the long, drawn out revenge<br>
> Of the cowardly enemy, who was beside you all along.<br>
> 
> In 2007, Robert Craig Knievel<br>
> Tells the *Hour of Power* Christian Telecast<br>
> About waking up and seeing the devil in his bedroom.<br>
> Speaking carefully and slowly,<br>
> The broken man explains to the congregation<br>
> How he rose up in bed and yelled:<br>
> "Devil! Devil!"<br>
> "You bastard, you! Get away from me!"<br>
> "I cast you out of my life!"<br>
> "I just got on my knees and prayed," said Evel.<br>
> "Got on my knees and prayed."<br>
> "I prayed that god would put his arms around me,<br>
> And never ever ever let me go."<br>
>
> He was not a good man,<br>
> But he was a Great Man.<br>
> And for that, he deserves<br>
> Mercy, Death. Mercy.
